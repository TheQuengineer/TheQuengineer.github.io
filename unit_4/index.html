    <p>
      I work as an automation engineer in the bay area. I graduated from Georgia State University in 2007.
      I learned to work with computers after I started working on side projects in college. I fell into test
      automation later in life based on my interest in writing small programs that produced most of my work for
      me. I decided to take a career option doing this permanently. Experimenting with this area of computing has
      also guided me toward a the field of Artifical Integlligence for further study. As long as there are computers
      my goal is to keep working on using them to automate tasks for us. The more and more connected and busy our lives get, the more I feel we will need it!

      <h3>Computer Science Interests</h3>
      <p>While working in this field I learned that in order to be successful you will need to enter the field with
      a specific interest. Because Computer Science is so broad I have found that I personally have gravitated
      to a few specific areas.</p>
      <p>These areas of study have been where I spend the majority of my time perfecting on my side projects. If I had to compose a list of these interest I would definietely narrow it down these...

       <ol>
         <li>Atificial Intelligence</li>
         <li>Expert Test Systems & Test Engineering Development</li>
